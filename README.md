# The causal effect of mental health on labor market outcomes: The case of stress-related mental disorders following a human-made disaster

# Project abstract
As disasters increase due to climate change, population density, epidemics, and technology, information is needed about post-disaster consequences for people’s mental health, and how stress-related mental disorders affect multiple spheres of life, including labor-market attachment.  We tested the causal hypothesis that individuals who developed stress-related mental disorders as a consequence of their disaster exposure experienced subsequent weak labor-market attachment and poor work-related outcomes. We leveraged a natural experiment in an instrumental variables model, studying a 2004 fireworks factory explosion disaster that precipitated the onset of stress-related disorders (post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression) among individuals in the local community (N=86,726). We measured labor-market outcomes using longitudinal population-level administrative data: Sick leave, unemployment benefits, early retirement pension, and income from wages from 2007 to 2010. We found that individuals who developed a stress-related disorder after the disaster were likely to go on sickness benefit, both in the short- and long-term, were likely to use unemployment benefits, and to lose wage income in the long-term. Stress-related disorders did not increase the likelihood of early retirement. The natural-experiment design minimized the possibility that omitted confounders biased these effects of mental health on work outcomes.  Addressing the mental health and employment needs of survivors after a traumatic experience may improve their labor-market outcomes and their nations’ economic outputs.
